# KGSynX: Knowledge Graph and Explainable Feedback Guided LLMs for Synthetic Tabular Data Generation

This repository contains code, data structure, and experiment scripts for our ISWC submission **KGSynX**, a framework for synthetic tabular data generation guided by knowledge graphs and SHAP-based feedback refinement.

## Directory Structure

- `data/`: Placeholder for raw and synthetic datasets.
- `src/`: Core implementation of KGSynX (data loading, KG construction, generation, SHAP refinement).
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks for exploratory analysis and pipeline demonstrations.
- `results/`: Output from experiments, including figures and logs.

## Setup

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
